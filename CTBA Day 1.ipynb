    "Strong vs. Weak AI\n",
    "- Strong; Attempt to simulate human reasoning; quest towards AGI\n",
    "- Weak; Designed to perform specific tasks without simulating general reasoning or consciousness \n",
    "    - This is sufficient for almost all, if not all business processes, and still results in huge competitive advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition\n",
    "- New firms which compete through technological innovation don't edge out older rivals purely through better operations; they reinvent the rules of the game\n",
    "    - AI, depending on the industry, can disrupt and redefine operations for firms\n",
    "    - Massively lowered marginal cost (virtually zero) for digital replication, especially through *algorithmic execution*\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Implications\n",
    "- AI extracts values from data, networks, and user interactions, not just products and services\n",
    "- In some cases, overcomes the limits of economy of scale, allowing (closer to) infinite scalability and adaptability \n",
    "    - Additional complexity has a much lower marginal cost\n",
    "- Traditional firms will die if they do not adapt; new companies are fundamentally different in architecture and strategy and cannot be beaten with old operational models\n",

    "    - More users = more data and exponential analytical potential\n",
    "    - More users = more value for external firms who sell on the platform - free work and platform stickiness\n",
