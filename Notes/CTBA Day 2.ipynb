    "**Rethinking the Firm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Review\n",
    "- Network effects and learning effects, which create additional value on top of physical products\n",
    "\n",
    "*AI*\n",
    "- Broad category, larger than genAI\n",
    "- AI is not a bolt-on tool; it should be a strategic driver and shaped to solve specific business problems\n",
    "- This is a transformation of how a business operates (culture shift) - transformative change\n",
    "    - Mission, data architecture, governance, and product-centric agility\n",
    "    - Reshaping of boundaries, industry position\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation\n",
    "- Shifting from human-centric to algorithm-centric workflows; new roles, processes, and governance\n",
    "- Data-driven thinking, agility, continuous experimentation; Focus on learning over intuition\n",
    "- Led by leadership, based on trust and transparency \n",
    "\n",
    "AI Readiness\n",
    "- Ability for an organization to adopt, implement, and scale AI\n",
    "    - Digital infrastructure\n",
    "        - Scalable, cloud-based, modern\n",
    "    - Data maturity\n",
    "        - Integrated data out of siloes into centralized platforms\n",
    "        - Strong governance\n",
    "    - Talent & Culture\n",
    "        - Empowered cross-functional teams\n",
    "    - Commitment from Leadership\n",
    "        - Technical, strategic, and governance leaders\n",
    "    - Experimentation & Learning Mindset\n",
    "        - Agile iteration and modular development\n",
    "- Alignment of firm strategy with digital and human resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative research has shown that there may be a positive correlation between AI maturity and financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operating Models and AI*\n",
    "- AI firms still need a consistent operating model; But built around data, algorithms, and digital platforms, instead of physical assets and labor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional\n",
    "- Physical supply-chains\n",
    "- Human decision-making\n",
    "- Marginal returns\n",
    "\n",
    "AI\n",
    "- Action stemming from learning derived from algorithms applied to data\n",
    "- Operations are embedded into the digital platforms\n",
    "- Growth can come from user interactions and automation, increasing marginal return \n",
    "\n",
    "Scale Economy\n",
    "- Increased production = cost advantage; AI automation also contributes\n",
    "- More operations, minimal cost increase\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope Economy\n",
    "- Effeciency formed by variety - offerings of multiple products/services\n",
    "- AI helps leverage shared data and infrastructure to increase variety \n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment\n",
    "- Creating value through cost, differentiation, etc.\n",
    "- Capturing value through pricing, advertising, etc.\n",
    "- Scaling operating model through increased volume and complexity, assisted by algorithms\n",
    "- Scope increased by adding variety to offerings\n",
    "- Learning to generate improvements and innovations\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Learning Model\n",
    "- Feedback loop of applying results from testing back to product design and decision-making\n",
    "    - A/B testing on products, pricing, interfaces, etc.\n",
    "    - Controlled trials\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategic Implications\n",
    "- Experimentation allows firms to adapt quickly \n",
    "- Agility is a competitive advantage; pivoting is necessary to adapt to changes and discoveries\n",
    "- Strategy must be informed by real-world data and results instead of intuition and assumptions\n",
    "- Scalable learning loops - feed experimentation back into business models \n",
    "- Stick to small experiments to lower risk of mistakes, which are inevitable\n",
    "\n",
    "# Are there still diminishing returns? Increasing size means higher difficulty of changing business model to respond to learning\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is it better for more 'physical' industries to focus on increasing variety rather than scale due to their physical limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is there a term for when a company becomes so ubiquitous that it changes its own market in a diminishing way (e.g. Tinder) - a 'universal' limit to growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Bottlenecks \n",
    "- AI can enable higher complexity work by lowering the amount of time and mistakes caused by human decision-making when applied to low-level decisions\n",
    "- Successfully automating low-level work provides a competitive advantage \n",
    "\n",
    "Irresistible Digital Bicycle\n",
    "- AI is a supplement to human cognitive work; Humans can process and act on much larger amounts of data in a shorter amount of time, enabling new business \n",
    "\n",
    "*Tacit vs Strategic AI*\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI can be used tactically to solve specific, short-term goals like operational improvements; a tool to automate a specific workflow\n",
    "- Strategic AI reshapes an organization's long-term essence, rethinking value and business models \n",
    "\n",
    "*High Performers*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good understanding of operating model\n",
    "- Commitment to talent acquisition and development for ML/AI professionals\n",
    "- Good metrics and transparency\n",
    "- Accessible, clean data \n",
    "\n",
    "*Toughest businesses for AI*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Healthcare; \n",
    "    - Complexity of data; fragmented, categorical, unstructured, sensitive\n",
    "    - High-stakes and reputational risk\n",
    "    - Regulation and oversight\n",
    "    - Low trust from stakeholders in the industry\n",
